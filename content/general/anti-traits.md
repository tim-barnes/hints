### Rigid



### Fragile



### Immobile

Can only be deployed in a specific way, or onto specific hardware.

### Viscous

Difficult to modify, or the effort to maintain the original design is far greater than 'a quick hack'.

### Complex

Contains unnecessary or useless code elements.

### Repetitive

Contains many similar or identical blocks of code.  Alternatively duplicates many functions across different implementation areas.

### Opaque

Code or design is difficult to understand.
